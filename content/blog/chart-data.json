  "chartDescriptions": {
    "pie": "a circular statistical graphic that divides data into proportional slices to show percentage or proportional data",
    "bar": "a chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars whose heights or lengths are proportional to the values they represent",
    "line": "a type of chart that displays information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments",
    "scatter": "a type of plot that uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables",
    "area": "a line chart where the area between the line and axis is filled with color or shading",
    "column": "a chart that uses vertical bars to compare values across categories",
    "donut": "a variation of pie charts with a hollow center, making them easier to read and more modern-looking",
    "heatmap": "a graphical representation of data where values are represented as colors in a matrix format",
    "funnel": "a chart that shows how data moves through a process, typically displaying decreasing values",
    "gauge": "a chart that displays a single value within a range, similar to a speedometer"

  "chartUseCases": {
    "pie": "showing proportional data, market share analysis, survey results, budget breakdowns, and categorical distributions",
    "bar": "comparing values across categories, ranking data, showing survey results, and displaying performance metrics",
    "line": "tracking changes over time, showing trends, displaying time series data, and monitoring performance",

    "area": "showing cumulative values over time, comparing multiple datasets, and emphasizing magnitude of change",
    "column": "comparing discrete categories, showing rankings, displaying survey data, and presenting grouped data",
    "donut": "displaying proportional data with better readability, modern dashboards, and when you need space for additional information in the center",
    "heatmap": "showing data density, correlation matrices, geographic data, time-based patterns, and large dataset visualization",

  "chartWhenToUse": {
    "pie": "- Display parts of a whole (percentages)\n- Show data with 3-7 categories for best readability\n- Highlight the largest or smallest segments\n- Present survey results or market share data\n- When exact values are less important than proportions",
    "bar": "- Compare values across different categories\n- Display rankings or ordered data\n- Show positive and negative values\n- Present survey results with multiple options\n- When category names are long (horizontal bars work better)",
    "line": "- Track changes over time periods\n- Show trends and patterns in data\n- Display continuous data\n- Compare multiple time series\n- Forecast future values based on historical trends",
    "scatter": "- Explore relationships between two numeric variables\n- Identify correlations and patterns\n- Detect outliers in your data\n- Perform regression analysis\n- Show distribution of data points",
    "area": "- Show cumulative totals over time\n- Compare multiple datasets with emphasis on magnitude\n- Display stacked data categories\n- Highlight the 'area under the curve'\n- Show how individual categories contribute to the total",
    "column": "- Compare discrete categories vertically\n- Display grouped or clustered data\n- Show data that fits better in vertical format\n- Present time series data with distinct periods\n- When you have space constraints horizontally",
    "donut": "- All the same use cases as pie charts\n- When you want a more modern, clean look\n- Need space in the center for additional information\n- Working with larger datasets (up to 12 categories)\n- Creating dashboard-style visualizations",
    "heatmap": "- Visualize large amounts of data in a compact format\n- Show patterns in time-based data (like website traffic by hour/day)\n- Display correlation between multiple variables\n- Geographic data visualization\n- When color coding adds meaning to your data",
    "funnel": "- Track conversion rates through a process\n- Analyze sales pipelines and stages\n- Monitor user journey through website/app\n- Identify bottlenecks in processes\n- Show progressive reduction in data",
    "gauge": "- Display single KPIs or metrics\n- Show performance against targets\n- Create dashboard indicators\n- Monitor real-time values\n- When you need an intuitive, speedometer-like display"
